//       Client-side Javascript
//       ========================
//       You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
//       on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
//       take advantage of Sails' boilerplate asset management.
//       By default, filesin your `assets/linker/js` folder are included here
//       automatically.  Both JavaScript (.js) and CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported.
//       In production, your scripts will be minified and concatenated into a single file.
//       To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit your Gruntfile.
//       For example, here are a few things you could do:
//       + Change the order of your scripts
//       + Import scripts from other directories
//       + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript
//     

// SCRIPTS
